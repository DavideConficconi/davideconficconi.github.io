We have just won the [TUM Global Incentive Fund (GIF)](https://www.international.tum.de/en/global/gif/) collaborative grant with the project "WHISKEY-AI: Accelerating Food Fermentation and Beverage Aging with Physics-Informed Edge AI to Reduce Environmental Impact" with [Melanie Köhler](http://linkedin.com/in/melanie-köhler-664752266) (TUM), [Ovidiu Șerban](https://ovidiu.roboslang.org/) (Imperial), and [Fabio Pizzetti](https://www.linkedin.com/in/fabio-pizzetti-300918186/) (Polimi).

Stay tuned because we are going to organize a new interdisciplinary research event!
